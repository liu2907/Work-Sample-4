Making a Request

(In an OKDHS office, Margie, a supervisor, is speaking privately with her employee, Jane.)

Margie: So what did you want to talk to me about, Jane?

Jane: I've been thinking about what we discussed previously. About my migraines?

Margie: Yes, have you decided what you would like to do?

Jane: I would like to ask for an accommodation per the ADA.

Margie: The ADA?

Jane: Yes. I've looked into it, and I believe this condition qualifies for me to have an ADA accommodation.

Margie: We have had ADA accommodations put in place before, but not for something like headaches.

Jane: From what I read, an ADA disability is a physical or mental health impairment that interferes with a major life activity. I believe my migraines interfering with my work qualifies.

Margie: Hmm. You may be right. The Office for Civil Rights handles ADA accommodations. Tell you what. I will give them a call and ask them about this. Is that acceptable to you?

Jane: Yes, thank you, Margie.

Margie: Great. I will let you know what I find out.
